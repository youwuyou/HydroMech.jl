# Part 1: 3D multi-XPUs diffusion solver
Steady state solution of a diffusive process for given physical time steps using the pseudo-transient acceleration (using the so-called "dual-time" method).

💡 Use [ParallelStencil.jl](https://github.com/omlins/ParallelStencil.jl) and [ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl](https://github.com/eth-cscs/ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl) for the (multi-)XPU implementation. You are free to use either `@parallel` or `@parallel_indices` type of kernel definition.

## Results
Results section

### 3D diffusion
Report an animation of the 3D solution here and provide and concise description of the results. _Unleash your creativity to enhance the visual output._

### Performance
Briefly elaborate on performance measurement and assess whether you are compute or memory bound for the given physics on the targeted hardware.

#### Memory throughput
Strong-scaling on CPU and GPU -> optimal "local" problem sizes.

#### Weak scaling
Multi-GPU weak scaling

#### Work-precision diagrams
Provide a figure depicting convergence upon grid refinement; report the evolution of a value from the quantity you are diffusing for a specific location in the domain as function of numerical grid resolution. Potentially compare against analytical solution.

Provide a figure reporting on the solution behaviour as function of the solver's tolerance. Report the relative error versus a well-converged problem for various tolerance-levels.
