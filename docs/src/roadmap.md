# Roadmap

## Preparation
- [ x ] Add comments on the code where you have questions or something is unclear
- [ x ] Try to change the setup and try to reproduce the porosity wave benchmark as in [Raess et al.](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/218/3/1591/5497299?login=true)


## Implementation

- [ x ] Add compressibility terms to two-phase flow equations
- [ x ] Reproduce fluid injection 1D benchmark in [Luca et al. 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195122003109)
- [ x ] Add rate- and state plasticity
- [   ] Reproduce earthquake cycle 2D benchmark with inertia and adaptive time stepping


## Further goals

- [ ] Further Benchmark
- [ ] Move to 3D
