Now one can see the advantages why we added one more layer of the abstraction: due to the massive amount of parameters needed in the original equations. In the current solve!(), we need not to explicitly unpack the variables from the struct, we used the Adapt.jl package in order to allow the use of struct members on GPUs.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/","page":"Tutorial","title":"Tutorial","text":"    while err > ε && iter <= iterMax\n        # timing\n        if (iter==11)  global wtime0 = Base.time()  end\n\n        # involve the incompressible TPF solver\n        @parallel compute_params_∇!(flow.𝞰ɸ, flow.𝐤ɸ_µᶠ, flow.𝞀g, flow.∇V, flow.∇qD, flow.𝝫, flow.Pf, flow.Pt, flow.V.x, flow.V.y, flow.qD.x, flow.qD.y, rheology.μˢ, _C, rheology.R, rheology.λp, rheology.k0, _ɸ0, rheology.nₖ, rheology.θ_e, rheology.θ_k, flow.ρfg, flow.ρsg, flow.ρgBG, _dx, _dy)\n\n        # pressure update from the conservation of mass flow\n        @parallel compute_residual_mass_law!(pt.dτPt, pt.dτPf, flow.R.Pt, flow.R.Pf, flow.𝐤ɸ_µᶠ, flow.∇V, flow.∇qD, flow.Pt, flow.Pf, flow.𝞰ɸ, flow.𝝫, pt.Pfsc, pt.Pfdmp, min_dxy2, _dx, _dy)\n        apply_free_slip!(freeslip, pt.dτPf, nx, ny)\n        @parallel compute_pressure!(flow.Pt, flow.Pf, flow.R.Pt, flow.R.Pf, pt.dτPf, pt.dτPt)\n        @parallel compute_tensor!(flow.𝞃.xx, flow.𝞃.yy, flow.𝞃.xy, flow.V.x, flow.V.y,  flow.∇V, flow.R.Pt, rheology.μˢ, pt.βₚₜ, _dx, _dy)\n\n    \n        # velocity update from the conservation of momentum flow\n        # for both fluid and solid\n        @parallel compute_residual_momentum_law!(flow.R.Vx, flow.R.Vy, pt.dVxdτ, pt.dVydτ, flow.𝞃.xx, flow.𝞃.yy, flow.𝞃.xy, flow.Pt, flow.𝞀g, pt.dampX, pt.dampY, _dx, _dy)\n        @parallel compute_velocity!(flow.V.x, flow.V.y, flow.qD.x, flow.qD.y, pt.dVxdτ, pt.dVydτ, flow.𝐤ɸ_µᶠ, flow.Pf, pt.dτV, flow.ρfg, flow.ρgBG, _dx, _dy)\n        apply_free_slip!(freeslip, flow.V.x, flow.V.y, nx+1, ny+1)\n        apply_free_slip!(freeslip, flow.qD.x, flow.qD.y, nx+1, ny+1)\n    \n        # update the porosity\n        @parallel compute_porosity!(flow.𝝫, flow.𝝫_o, flow.∇V, flow.∇V_o, CN, Δt)\n\n\n\n        # ... error updates\n    end","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/#Evolution-Operators","page":"Tutorial","title":"Evolution Operators","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorial/","page":"Tutorial","title":"Tutorial","text":"One can see a solve!() routine defined in src/solvers as wrapper for many some update kernels which are defined within separate scripts of src/evolution_operators.
